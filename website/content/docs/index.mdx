# Welcome to ucharm

**ucharm** is a CLI toolkit for building beautiful command-line applications with Python syntax, powered by [PocketPy](https://pocketpy.dev). 

Write in familiar Python, ship as single-file executables under 1MB that start in milliseconds.

## Why ucharm?

- **Instant startup** - Under 10ms cold start, no interpreter warm-up
- **Tiny binaries** - Single-file executables under 1MB
- **Python syntax** - No new language to learn
- **Beautiful output** - Tables, boxes, progress bars, colors built-in
- **Interactive prompts** - Select, multiselect, confirm with keyboard navigation
- **50+ native modules** - JSON, HTTP, SQLite, regex, and more in native Zig

## Quick Example

```python
from ucharm import box, table, success, select

# Beautiful boxes
box("Welcome to my app!", title="Hello", border_color="cyan")

# Interactive prompts
choice = select("Pick an option:", ["Deploy", "Test", "Exit"])

# Formatted tables
table([
    ["Status", "Count"],
    ["Passed", "42"],
    ["Failed", "0"],
], headers=True)

success(f"Selected: {choice}")
```

## What's Different?

ucharm is **not** a drop-in replacement for CPython. It's a focused runtime optimized for CLI applications:

| Feature | ucharm | CPython |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Startup time | ~5ms | ~50ms+ |
| Binary size | ~1MB | ~100MB+ |
| Dependencies | None | pip ecosystem |
| TUI components | Built-in | Requires packages |
