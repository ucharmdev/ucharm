# ucharm Vision

This document captures the product vision, the CLI experience we want, and the
minimum module surface needed to make ucharm a great choice for shipping CLI
apps as tiny, fast, standalone binaries.

## Vision

ucharm makes it easy to build great command-line apps with Python syntax and
ship them as single-file binaries that start instantly and work anywhere.

We will not chase full CPython or pip compatibility. The goal is a focused,
curated runtime optimized for CLI applications: beautiful output, solid IO,
predictable packaging, and fast startup.

## What It Should Feel Like

- A Pythonic developer experience with very low friction.
- Tiny binaries with instant startup and no external runtime dependencies.
- Clean, beautiful output by default (tables, progress, prompts).
- Reliable scripting primitives (files, subprocess, paths, env).
- Clear limitations and a predictable compatibility story.

## Example CLIs (what "nice" looks like)

### Simple status + table

```python
import charm
import subprocess

charm.box("Deploying build...", title="Release", border="rounded")
result = subprocess.run(["git", "rev-parse", "--short", "HEAD"], capture_output=True)
commit = result["stdout"].decode().strip()
charm.success(f"Built commit {commit}")

charm.table(
    [
        ["Artifact", "Size", "Time"],
        ["app-linux", "900KB", "6ms"],
        ["app-macos", "910KB", "7ms"],
    ],
    headers=True,
)
```

### Interactive flow

```python
import input
import charm

charm.rule("Project Setup")
name = input.prompt("Project name:")
features = input.multiselect("Select features:", ["Logging", "HTTP", "Config"])
if input.confirm("Create project now?", default=True):
    charm.success(f"Created {name} with {len(features)} features")
else:
    charm.warning("Canceled")
```

### Progress + subprocess

```python
import charm
import subprocess

charm.progress(0, 100, label="Uploading")
result = subprocess.run(["/usr/bin/scp", "dist/app", "prod:/apps/"], capture_output=True)
if result["returncode"] == 0:
    charm.success("Upload complete")
else:
    charm.error("Upload failed")
```

## Example Output (what it should look like)

```
╭─ Release ─────────────────────────────╮
│ Deploying build...                    │
╰───────────────────────────────────────╯

## Gold Set (must be great for CLI apps)

### Core CLI APIs

- argument parsing and help output
- subcommands and groups
- shell completion generation
- config loading (ini/toml at minimum)
- logging with levels and formatting
- robust subprocess API
- structured output: tables, boxes, progress, spinners

### Runtime Guarantees

- fast startup (< 10 ms)
- small binaries (< 2MB range)
- predictable behavior across macOS and Linux
- clear error messages and exit codes

## Standard Library Support (tiered)

### Essential

These are required for real-world CLI usage and should be high parity.

- argparse
- os, sys, time
- pathlib, glob, fnmatch
- subprocess, signal
- json, csv
- logging
- datetime
- textwrap
- tempfile, shutil
- re
- hashlib (subset OK, but stable)

### Good to have

These unlock common workflows and popular CLI libraries.

- configparser
- enum
- uuid
- urllib.parse
- contextlib
- typing (runtime stubs)
- statistics, functools, itertools, heapq

### Nice to have

Useful for some apps but not required for most CLIs.

- toml
- http.client (or a small fetch module)
- gzip, zipfile, tarfile
- secrets, hmac
- dataclasses
- xml.etree
- sqlite3 (large - is there an efficient way?)

### Probably will not need

Low value for typical CLI apps or too heavy to justify.

- multiprocessing
- decimal, fractions
- tkinter, curses
- site, venv, distutils

## Positioning

ucharm is for CLI tools that want:

- Python ergonomics
- small, portable binaries
- fast startup
- beautiful terminal UX

It is not a drop-in replacement for CPython or pip.

## Success Metrics

- "hello world" binary < 2MB and starts in <= 10ms on macOS and Linux.
- 90%+ parity for essential modules listed above.
- polished UX for prompts, tables, progress, and error output.
- at least one production-grade sample CLI app in the repo.

## Runtime Decision (PocketPy)

We are choosing PocketPy as the runtime base for ucharm.

Why:
- Velocity: we reached 22/22 Vision tests quickly and maintain a curated CPython-compatibility suite for targeted stdlib modules (see `tests/compat_report_pocketpy.md`).
- Extension workflow: PocketPy is easier to extend in Zig without macro-heavy friction, so missing modules are faster to implement and maintain.
- Product fit: binaries remain small (sub‑1MB in current builds) with startup ~2ms; this fits the <10ms startup target and keeps headroom for curated stdlib.

Decision implications:
- Continue investing in Zig-native modules on PocketPy.
- MicroPython is not part of the repo anymore; keep historical comparisons for context only.
